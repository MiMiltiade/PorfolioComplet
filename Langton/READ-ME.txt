This is an other version of Langton's ant;

that ant is a simple cellular automata whit a strange behavior before 10.000 iterations.
In fact she begin to do an 'highway' like she want to escape the program. 

That version was made without Canvas, but with a grid in html/css created in Javascript with an array.

To enjoy it, push the space bar and wait 10.000 iterations to see the magic happening.

Enjoy
